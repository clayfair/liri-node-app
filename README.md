# liri-node-app

# Overview

In this assignment, I will make LIRI. LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives me back data.

I'll be utilizing Twitter, Spotify and OMDB's APIs to build this app.
